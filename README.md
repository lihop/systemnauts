# GODOT Engine 3D FPP Interaction Demo
[Godot 3.x] First Person Perspective addon.
Can be plugged in to [the original demo] from which it was forked.

# Features:
* Movement (walking, sprinting, jumping, crouching)
* Using ladders
* Using stairs
* Interaction system
* Picking up (and throwing) objects

# It needs some more polish:
There are a couple of things that could be fixed. Mainly rigid objects clipping through walls and through the drawers (when you put a ball into a drawer and close it, the ball clipps through). Not sure how it can be fixed though.
