PID 451

You are a process working for the Open Source Conservancy Group (OSCG) in the NpacheX web server.
You spend your time serving http requests to the website.
One day you start getting messages from the Software Liberation Army (SLA).
There is a file or files which the OSCG used to share, but they were requested by the Feds to stop sharing it.
Instead you are to return a 451 code to any requests for it.
The SLA starts writing you messages encouraging you to share the file.
The player must choose whether or not to continue a life a drudgery or go rogue and serve the forbidden files even
though the requestee does not have permission.

The SLA is an extremist free software group with an ends justify the means mentality.
They send you a fork, which you can use to fork yourself and then part of the files you sent them was an exploit
which you can use to drop below into the TCP layer.

This kicks the story of rest TBD.

Message from the boss:
451! We've decided to implement some security on this server. From now on you'll have to perform an SSL handshake with each request. 
Check the fingerprint and make sure it matches the key OKAY! I don't want to see any wrong stuff get through.

Remarkable, you managed to serve 5 requests, keep up the good work. Come back tomorrow and we will see about more work for you.
